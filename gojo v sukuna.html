    <h2 style="color: purple;">Satoru Gojo vs Ryomen Sukuna: The Battle of the Strongest</h2>
<p>The Battle of the Strongest in Jujutsu Kaisen refers to the long-awaited fight between Satoru Gojo and Ryomen Sukuna, two of the most powerful figures in the entire series. Gojo, hailed as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer of the modern age, embodies the pinnacle of contemporary sorcery through his mastery of the Six Eyes and the Limitless technique. Sukuna, on the other hand, is the “King of Curses,” an ancient being whose power once ruled over the jujutsu world a thousand years ago. Their confrontation represents not just a clash of power, but a symbolic meeting between modern mastery and ancient supremacy — the best of the present against the ultimate of the past.
</p>
<p>The fight takes place during the Shinjuku Showdown Arc, one of the most anticipated moments in the manga. From the start, both combatants demonstrate why they are revered as “the strongest.” Gojo unleashes the full extent of his Limitless technique, manipulating space itself with terrifying precision, while also employing his Domain Expansion, Unlimited Void, to trap Sukuna in infinite sequences of information. Sukuna, however, proves that he is far more than a brute force of cursed energy. Using his immense intellect, experience, and mastery of multiple cursed techniques — including those obtained through the Ten Shadows Technique — he manages to adapt to Gojo’s overwhelming attacks and counter with devastating precision.
</p>
<p>Throughout most of the battle, Gojo seems to dominate. His composure, skill, and control of space make him nearly untouchable, and for a time, it feels as though even Sukuna cannot match his perfection. However, the tide begins to turn as Sukuna gradually reveals more of his true power, culminating in the use of his World Splitting Slash — a technique capable of cutting through even space itself. Despite Gojo’s best efforts and his relentless confidence, Sukuna ultimately gains the upper hand and defeats him, marking one of the most shocking moments in Jujutsu Kaisen.
</p>
<p>This battle is not just about who can hit harder; it’s a complex demonstration of strategy, technique, and willpower. Gojo’s brilliance lies in his near-perfect command over cursed energy, while Sukuna’s strength comes from his adaptability, intelligence, and raw cursed energy output that surpasses any living being. Even after his victory, Sukuna himself acknowledges Gojo’s strength, suggesting that in another era or under different circumstances, the result might have been different.

<p>In the end, while Sukuna stands as the victor and the “strongest” overall within the series’ narrative, Gojo remains the embodiment of peak sorcery — the strongest human jujutsu sorcerer of his time. Their battle serves as a turning point in the story, redefining what “strength” truly means in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe: it’s not merely about power, but the fusion of mastery, intellect, and resolve.
